![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/9186fd91-0911-4643-9c6b-2733547c8417)

"Unlike other biblical or Christian games, LOGOS does not seek to eliminate the violent part of the Bible, on the contrary, it is intended to show the Bible for what it is: A point of controversy for some and a source of inspiration to others. Designed for Windows®, Mac OS® and Linux®, LOGOS is an independent development that took 3 years to complete; it is non-profit and was not capitalized on in sites like Kickstarter. We are still updating it!" [https://tecomprendo.itch.io/logos-bible-video-game](https://abigailmmoore.github.io/ChristianVideoGames/)

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/b7032db2-5146-48c8-904a-7aa48b79f1bb)

"There is an underground occult in Monotheos City and their plans are to take control over the city's valuable resources. The occult has taken over half the the nation with demonic influences. But Monotheos City is the location that the occult needs to really put an end to the city's Godly influence on the other surrounding states. Because Monotheos is surrounded by some of the largest bodies of water in the nation, it is a huge asset for the Demonic Occult. The occult wants to use the water to accelerate their demonic serum agenda. They want to steal the city's landmark bible tech and apply it in advancing the ease of their own occult bibles. The city's bibles are infused with state-of-the-art technology that makes the bible easier to understand and remember for visual learners within the city. The occult leader puts his plan in motion and uses five of his demonic occult generals to steal the city's technology. The occult leader then goes after the potential Godly threats in the area to solidify his plans to take over Monotheos."
