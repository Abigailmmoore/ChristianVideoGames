"AREA MAN LIVES. Or does he? If you could join a radio drama already in progress, talk to the characters and interact with the environments the story painted in your mind, you might find yourself in the world of the area man. A quirky radio drama unfolds around you in VR while you do your best to keep the radio station humming along as its new DJ. You record commercials, interview callers and try your best to piece together how your actions inside the station impact your listening audience in scenarios so wild they can only live in your imagination."

"Unlike other biblical or Christian games, LOGOS does not seek to eliminate the violent part of the Bible, on the contrary, it is intended to show the Bible for what it is: A point of controversy for some and a source of inspiration to others.

We are still updating it!" [https://tecomprendo.itch.io/logos-bible-video-game](https://tecomprendo.itch.io/logos-bible-video-game)

"There is an underground occult in Monotheos City and their plans are to take control over the city's valuable resources. The occult has taken over half the the nation with demonic influences. But Monotheos City is the location that the occult needs to really put an end to the city's Godly influence on the other surrounding states. Because Monotheos is surrounded by some of the largest bodies of water in the nation, it is a huge asset for the Demonic Occult. The occult wants to use the water to accelerate their demonic serum agenda. They want to steal the city's landmark bible tech and apply it in advancing the ease of their own occult bibles. The city's bibles are infused with state-of-the-art technology that makes the bible easier to understand and remember for visual learners within the city. The occult leader puts his plan in motion and uses five of his demonic occult generals to steal the city's technology. The occult leader then goes after the potential Godly threats in the area to solidify his plans to take over Monotheos."
